📘 Project: Advanced BMI Calculator
🎯 Objective
To create an interactive web-based tool that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) and Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) based on user inputs like weight, height, age, and gender. It also provides personalized health tips based on the BMI category.

🛠️ How It Works
1. User Input
The user fills in the following fields:

Weight (in kilograms)

Height (in meters or centimeters – selectable)

Age

Gender

2. Height Unit Selector
Users can choose whether to enter height in meters (m) or centimeters (cm).

If "cm" is selected, the code converts it to meters by dividing the value by 100 (because BMI formula uses meters).

javascript
Copy
Edit
const height = heightUnit === "cm" ? heightInput / 100 : heightInput;
3. BMI Calculation
The BMI is calculated using the standard formula:

BMI
=
Weight (kg)
Height (m)
2
BMI= 
Height (m) 
2
 
Weight (kg)
​
 
Example:

Weight = 60 kg, Height = 1.65 m
BMI = 60 / (1.65 × 1.65) ≈ 22.0

The result is shown with one decimal point using .toFixed(1).

4. BMI Category
Based on the BMI value, the user is placed into one of the following categories:

BMI Value	Category	Color Indicator
< 18.5	Underweight	Orange
18.5 – 24.9	Normal Weight	Green
25.0 – 29.9	Overweight	Orange-Red
30.0 or higher	Obese	Red
This helps the user understand where they stand in terms of health.

5. BMR Calculation
The Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) estimates how many calories your body needs to function at rest.

Two different formulas are used based on gender:

Male:

𝐵
𝑀
𝑅
=
10
×
weight
+
6.25
×
height (cm)
−
5
×
age
+
5
BMR=10×weight+6.25×height (cm)−5×age+5
Female:

𝐵
𝑀
𝑅
=
10
×
weight
+
6.25
×
height (cm)
−
5
×
age
−
161
BMR=10×weight+6.25×height (cm)−5×age−161
This value helps users know how many calories they burn per day doing nothing, which can be used for planning diets or workouts.

6. Personalized Health Tips
The calculator also gives friendly health suggestions depending on the BMI category:

Underweight → Gain weight tips

Normal → Maintain current lifestyle

Overweight → Exercise & eat mindfully

Obese → Seek medical advice

7. Interactive & Stylish UI
Clean and modern look using CSS

Smooth animations (like fadeIn, slideFade)

Colors and icons make it easy to understand the output

💡 Technologies Used
HTML – For structure and form

CSS – For styling and animation

JavaScript – For all the logic and interactivity

✅ Key Features
Unit selection (cm/m for height)

BMI and BMR results

Color-coded feedback

Smart error handling for missing inputs

Responsive design for all screen sizes

🧠 Conclusion
This project is a practical example of how front-end web development can be used to build health-related tools that are helpful, visually appealing, and easy to use.
